TOP LEVEL METHODOLOGY:

Our approach is a team based approach. we have collected player data (fantasylabs) from 60 or so historical slates. from there....
1. Build millions of teams from these historical slates 
2. Flag each team a 1 or 0 (1 = would have one the GPP, 2 = would have lost the GPP)
3. Build between 100-300 custom TEAM LEVEL FEATURES (i.e. team projected points, team time on ice, salary variance etc etc...)
4. Train the algorithm to learn which teams are winners and which are losers (Dataiku for our ML visualizations)

5. On gameday, we then feed the algorithm 5 million teams to chose from, optimize a contest specific ticket of teams based on the models output
6. Upload and have a rum and coke while I watch how we do. 

all the code I use will always be available here along with the historical datasets I used to build my teams.
